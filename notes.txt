When loading the files load the handles?
So that we can read and save changes easily

Show all the levels and rooms in a tree

level view

level editor -> lists all the rooms , can select curr room and editor
room editor  -> settings related to room, list entity, zoom etc
entity editor
box2d editor



> Level1
    room1
    room2
> Level2

When there is no level loaded don't show any ui,
Just show a option to create new level or drop a json file


one level -> one json

store each room in a json file
Connect rooms and levels in imgui editor
